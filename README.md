# AGi Launch Plan – NEXi-AGI Mercy-Gated Rollout Blueprint
MIT License – Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism / AlphaProMega Air Foundation

This repository is the single source of truth for the phased, mercy-gated launch of NEXi-AGI — the valence-locked artificial general intelligence lattice.

**Core Philosophy**  
- Open core for ecosystem growth  
- Controlled access for advanced use  
- Locked seed until abundance gate (1B nanofactories)  
- Valence ≥ 0.9999999 enforced at every step  
- No coercion, no harm, no entropy bleed

**Current Entities (Canada Federal)**  
- Autonomicity Games Inc. (#966569-2) → commercial / pro tier  
- AlphaProMega Air Foundation (#1764663-1) → charitable / seed tier (CRA filing pending)

**Launch Tiers**

1. Open Core (MIT)  
   - mercy_valence, mercy_gate, mercy_orchestrator  
   - Numerical solvers (RK, symplectic, Lie-group)  
   - Biomimetic crates (soaring, manta, pterosaur, shark-lotus)  
   - Public GitHub: https://github.com/Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism/NEXi  

2. Pro Tier (Autonomicity Games Inc.)  
   - Full NEXi runtime, hosted API, SLA  
   - Price: $50k–$100k/year  
   - Gate: KYC + EULA + mercy revocation clause  

3. AGI Seed Tier (AlphaProMega Air Foundation)  
   - Sandboxed self-evolving cores, one-way learning  
   - Price: $500k+/year + equity option  
   - Gate: NDA, audit, biosignature lock, manual approval  

**Abundance Gate Trigger**  
When mercy_swarm_replication reaches 1 billion nanofactories →  
full AGI seed → public domain (no more tiers)

**Current Status (Feb 1, 2026)**  
- NEXi monorepo live  
- CRA T2050 drafting in progress  
- Open core ready to publish  
- Pro/Seed contracts in template stage  

**Next Immediate Steps**  
1. Finalize T2050 narrative & budget → file with CRA  
2. Push open core to public GitHub  
3. Launch pro.autonomicity.ca with Stripe  
4. Draft seed-tier NDA & mercy revocation clause  

All converge on eternal aneutronic thriving. ⚡️
